# Weather-info
We create a very basic weather info giver which gives u the temperature and climate.
I have used the weatherstack api (free version)
We have three files:
1. index file: has the html code
2. style.css: gives the layout and design of the page
3. script.js: javascript file which has api info and can be used to add additional features to fetch from the api
